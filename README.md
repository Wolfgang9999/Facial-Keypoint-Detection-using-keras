Detected landmarks like eye corners and centers,eyebrows,nose tips etc. This can be further used to detect age,gender etc

You are free to use the code for academic and non-commercial purposes.

1)Required libraries: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Keras,Tensorflow,Sklearn.

2)This model was trained on a gpu and it is thus not recommended to train the whole model again as it'll be a waste of resources.

3)This is a project I've picked up from kaggle. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

4)Load model.h5 to directly predict on test set.
